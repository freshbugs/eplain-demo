# eplain-demo

This is for my own future reference.
I'm trying to figure out how to do fancy things in plain tex, like graphics, and hyperlinks.
There seem to be two low-level approaches:
pdftex, or tex followed by dvipdfm or dvipdfmx.
Here I'm using eplain and other packages.
I guess behind the scenes they figure out which low-level approach to use.
